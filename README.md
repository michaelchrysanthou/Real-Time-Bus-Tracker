# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This project shows a map of Boston, and the route a bus takes from MIT to Harvard.  I have used data from Mapbox and also incorporated a Marker set to a timer to show an animated look at the bus route.  I changed the map view to a satellite view as it seemed to give the project more life and also changed the styling of the button.

This is a simple project to run, where the button in the top left starts the bus route.  Once it ends the page must be reloaded to start again.

I would like to make a more interactive version of this that incorporates a bus schedule.
